# Contributing to toml++
Contributions are very welcome! Either by [reporting issues] or submitting pull requests.
If you wish to submit a PR, please be aware that:
- The single-header file `toml.hpp` is generated by a script; make your changes in the files in
    `include`, **not** in `toml.hpp`.
- Your changes should compile warning-free on at least one of gcc 8.3.0, clang 8.0, and MSVC 19.2X
    (Visual Studio 2019). All three is a bonus.
- You should regenerate the single-header file as part of your PR (a CI check will fail if you don't).

<br>

## Regenerating toml.hpp
1. Make your changes as necessary
    - If you've added a new header file that isn't going to be transitively included by one of the
        others, add an include directive to `include/toml++/toml.h`
3. Run `python/generate_single_header.py`

<br>

## Building and running the tests
Testing is done using [Catch2], included in the respository as a submodule under `extern/Catch2`.
The first time you want to begin testing you'll need to ensure submodules have been fetched:  
```bash
git submodule update --init extern/Catch2
git submodule update --init extern/tloptional
```

### Testing on Windows with Visual Studio

Install [Visual Studio 2019] and [Test Adapter for Catch2], then open `vs/toml++.sln` and build the
projects in the `tests` solution folder. Visual Studio's Test Explorer should pick these up and
allow you to run the tests directly.

If test discovery fails you can usually fix it by enabling
`Auto Detect runsettings Files` (settings gear icon > `Configure Run Settings`).

### Testing on Linux (and WSL)
Install [meson] and [ninja] if necessary, then test with both gcc and clang:
```bash
CXX=g++ meson build-gcc
CXX=clang++ meson build-clang
cd build-gcc && ninja && ninja test
cd ../build-clang && ninja && ninja test
```
